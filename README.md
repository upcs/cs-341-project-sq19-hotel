# UPAF
The University of Portland Academic Forum

This is a forum designed for all University of Portland students and professors in order to organize communication outside the classroom and connect peers to form study groups and tutoring sessions.

This forum is a web app created using Node.js with a PHP and MySQL backend. Note that all commits must be submitted for review through a pull request. They also must pass the tests run through via Jest and reported by Travis-CI.
